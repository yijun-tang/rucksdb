//! A database can be configured with a custom FilterPolicy object.
//! This object is responsible for creating a small filter from a set
//! of keys.  These filters are stored in leveldb and are consulted
//! automatically by leveldb to decide whether or not to read some
//! information from disk. In many cases, a filter can cut down the
//! number of disk seeks form a handful to a single disk seek per
//! DB::Get() call.
//! 
//! Most people will want to use the builtin bloom filter support (see
//! NewBloomFilterPolicy() below).
